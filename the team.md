			<h2>Lab Alumni</h2>
		</header>
		<p><b>Hao-En Chin 秦皓恩 (Undergrad 2021-2023):</b> Hao-En worked as a postgraduate research technician in the lab. He helped perform avoidance learning experiments on lizards and domestic chicks. He will re-join the lab soon as a research assistant.</p>
		<p><b>Hui-Chi Liu 劉蕙綺 (Undergrad 2021-2024):</b> Hui-Chi mainly worked with Müllerian butterflies during her time in the lab. She is now a Master's student with Dr. Po-An Lin at NTU.</p>
		<p><b>Ching-Ning Yeh 葉晴寧 (Undergrad 2022-2024):</b> Ching-Ning worked on both lizards and butterflies in the lab. She is now a Master's student with Dr. David Zelený at NTU.</p>
		<p><b>Yu-Zhe Wu 巫宇哲 (Research Assistant 2023-2024):</b> Yu-Zhe was a research assistant working on lizards but played a key role in all projects of the lab. He is now a Master's student with Dr. You-Yin Chen at NYCU working on brain-machine interface.</p>
		<p><b>Ai-Ching Meng 孟艾晴 (Undergrad 2023-2025):</b> Ai-Ching mainly participated in the lizard learning experiments but also helped with our butterfly project. She is now a Master's student with Dr. Hsi-Cheng Ho at NTU.</p>
		<p><b>Yu-Hsi Chen 陳又璽 (Undergrad 2023-2025):</b> Yu-Hsi also participated in the lizard learning experiments. He is pursuing a career in helping animal shelters develop a social media presence.</p>
		<p><b>Hsin-Yen Lu 呂欣彥 (Undergrad 2024-2025):</b> Hsi-Yen helped convert butterfly wing images into animations that we could potentially use in the field to show bird predators. He is now a Master's student at NUT.</p>
