			<h2>Our research</h2>
		</header>
		<p> Our group is broadly interested in behavioral and evolutionary ecology, especially regarding how ecology shapes behavioral diversity and its evolutionary implications. We use a wide variety of approaches, including laboratory behavioral experiments, field research, meta-analyses, and theoretical modeling. We mainly use lizards and butterflies as study animals but are open to other organisms as along as they are tractable and appropriate for the questions of interest.</p>  
		<p> 我們的專長是行為和演化生態，尤其對生態環境如何影響行為的多樣性特別有興趣。我們研究的方法很多元：行為實驗、田野資料、大數據分析以及理論模擬都有包含。我們研究的物種目前以蜥蜴與蝴蝶為主，但只要條件適合，其他的物種我們也會考慮使用。</p>

					<h3>Genetics vs plasticity in shaping behavioral diversity</h3>
				</header>
				<p>Behaviors often exhibit remarkable variation at the individual level and beyond. To what extent is such variation produced by underlying genetic differentiations vs. plasticity, however, is less well understood yet very important in understanding behavioral evolution. Utilizing a quantitative genetic approach, we use boldness and avoidance foraging behavior in lizards as the system to answer this question.</p>

					<h3>Predator learning and warning signal diversity</h3>
				</header>
				<p>Stable coexistence of multiple warning signals poses an evolutionary puzzle -  theory says it shouldn't happen, yet we find it in lots of communities in nature. One potential solution might be how predators learn. Using warning signals in butterflies as the study system, we combine computer simulations, meta-analysis, and field learning experiments to understand how “smart” predators might allow multiple warning signals to persist in the same habitat.</p>

					<h3>The effects of climate change on species and communities</h3>
				</header>
				<p>Climate change and its influences on species is a pressing concern for all biologists and has led to a new research theme in our group. Pulling big data from ecological databases, we integrate three approaches - species distribution models, life-history analysis, and food-web models - to understand what kind of species would be impacted the most by warming climates, and how this might affect the community as a whole. Even though we don't go out to sea ourselves, we construct <i>in silico</i> marine fish communities to help answer these questions.</p>
