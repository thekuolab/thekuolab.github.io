<b>People with all identities and backgrounds are welcome to join our group. As long as space and resources allow, we are always open to recruiting new members. Active openings will also be posted here, too.</b> 

<h3>Postdocs</h3>
I don't have funding for postdocs at the moment, but there are funding opportunities through NSTC and some other sources. Get in touch if you are interested in doing a postdoc with us, and we can figure out a plan together.

<h3>PhD and Master's students</h3>
We are always looking for motivated graduate students to join the team. If you think what we do matches your interest, don't hesitate to reach out. It would be helpful if you could attach your CV in the email and tell me your research ideas, so we can have a basis for discussions.

<h3>Undergraduate students</h3>
We welcome committed undergraduate students to join the lab. If you want to have some research experience and are interested in what we do, feel free to email or stop by my office so we can have a chat.
