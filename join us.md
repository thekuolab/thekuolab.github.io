<b>People with all identities and backgrounds are welcome to join our group. As long as space and resources allow, we are always open to recruiting new members. Active openings will also be posted here.</b> 

For prospective graduate students and postdocs: I will not respond to generic inquiries that do not explain why our group is a good fit or applicants from completely unrelated research fields. If you happen to be from a very different research background but are genuine about joining, please make sure to let me know your reasons.

<h3>Postdocs</h3>
I have a three-year project funded by NSTC that can allow me to hire a postdoc. If you are interested in any of these topics - population dynamics of MÃ¼llerian mimicry butterflies, avoidance learning, and chemical ecology - I'd love to hear from you! 

[comment]: # (switch to this when there's no funding for postdocs - I don't have funding for postdocs at the moment, but there are funding opportunities through NSTC and some other sources. Get in touch if you are interested in doing a postdoc with us, and we can figure out a plan together.)

<h3>PhD and Master's students</h3>
We are always looking for motivated graduate students to join the team. If you think what we do matches your interest, don't hesitate to reach out. It would be helpful to attach your CV in the email and tell me your research ideas so we can have a basis for discussion.

<h3>Undergraduate students</h3>
We welcome committed undergraduate students to join the lab. If you want to have some research experience and are interested in what we do, feel free to email or stop by my office to have a chat.
